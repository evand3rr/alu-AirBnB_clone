The AirBnB Clone Project
![alt text](image.png)

Project Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project, where we worked on the project's backend while interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in Python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a JSON file and can be accessed with the help of the JSON module in python.

Description of the command interpreter:
The application's interface is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for using the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend, which was developed with Python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

show
create
update
destroy
count
As part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the following actions can be performed:

Creating new objects (ex, a new User or a New Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database, etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object
How to start it
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing.

Installing
You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.
